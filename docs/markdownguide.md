# Markdown Guide

### "#"
```

# page name

each additional bash is a heading

##  - h2

### - h3

#### - h4

##### - h5

```

The table of contents on the right of the webpage will draw its order of hierarchy from these "#" headings.

### Dividers

You can create a line to divide the page with 3 consecutive hyphens.

```markdown

    ---


```

### Code Blocks

The code-blocks with the cool little copy buttons?
It's three backticks for the beginning, and three to mark the end of the square, like so.

```markdown
    ```
    ```
```
``` like this ```

You can create this monstrosity:

??? note "Button"
    They can be nested using the indentation on the current line:

    ??? note "Another Button?"    
        ```markdown 
            ??? note "Need HELP?"
                ??? note "No, seriously????"    
                    And then here is the content  
        ```


```markdown 
    ??? note "Need HELP?"
        Here is some content.
        ??? note "No, seriously????"    
            Even more content.  
```
