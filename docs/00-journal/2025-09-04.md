# 04/09/25 - Old GitHub Repos

I realised that if I view my profile as someone else, like in an incognito window, it says I only have 12 repositories.  WHAT?!  I have 62!  I investigated and see that northcoders have made all of the work I did there private.  Sad times.  So I've gone through my GitHub repos, filtered by private only and made as many as I could public, there were a good few that I made private because they aren't good or anything but neither is anything else so what the heck.
