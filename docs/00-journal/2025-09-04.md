# 04/09/25 - Old GitHub Repos

I realised that if I view my profile as someone else, like in an incognito window, it says I only have 12 repositories.  WHAT?!  I have 62!  I investigated and see that northcoders have made all of the work I did there private.  Sad times.  So I've gone through my GitHub repos, filtered by private only and made as many as I could public, there were a good few that I made private because they aren't good or anything but neither is anything else so what the heck.

I have done the unthinkable.
I made a git hook that copies my README.md to docs/01-Tech/installationguide.md every time i commit, and it commits the copy too.

I didn't know you could do that, that's awesome, like making a symlink for a github repo.

.git/hooks/pre-commit
```

cp README.md docs/01-Tech/installationguide.md

git add docs/01-Tech/installationguide.md

```

That's it.  Plain and simple, but it's automation.
