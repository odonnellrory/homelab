#27/08/25 - rewriting README

another day another dollar


opened laptop
its my old ubuntu one i havent used in a long time.   
which is good for this site because i can write how to set it up from fresh.

```
    git clone https://github.com/odonnellrory/odonnellrory.github.io.git
    cd odonnellrory.github.io

```

you'll need python, and if you're on a system with apt like Debian based systems this command should do it for you.


```bash

    sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip

```

oh ffs i haven't updated this thing in a year and a halfI guess that's a bonus to this docs project, because I'll have this problem again in a year and a half.

```
    sudo apt get update

```

so for the README


```
    git clone https://github.com/odonnellrory/odonnellrory.github.io.git
    cd odonnellrory.github.io

```

you'll need python, and if you're on a system with apt like Debian based systems this command should do it for you.


```bash

    sudo apt get update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip

```

btw ctrl+a then ctrl+k deletes everything in the command line (yes that is the right term, it deletes everything on that line, the line you write the commands, the COMMAND + LINE)

---


??? note "Troubleshooting"
    **“The 'awesome-pages' plugin is not installed”**  
    Activate the venv and reinstall deps:
    ```bash
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

You can edit the names of the files with the #title on line one.

## new README



# Introduction

This site uses [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) + GitHub Pages.

Once this is set up, I edit the website by simply writing to a markdown file on my machine.

The files are saved locally, push them to GitHub, GitHub Actions will host the repo as a website.  [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/) will organise the Markdown files automatically into navigatable HTML.  

I plan to use this to document a lot of the projects that I have made over the last year, and any projects that I work on in the future.

Notes are in /docs/00-journal/.

---

# Installation

```zsh

    git clone https://github.com/odonnellrory/odonnellrory.github.io.git
    cd odonnellrory.github.io

```

## Host locally

### Debian (Ubuntu, Mint, etc)

You'll need python to run it locally.

```zsh

    sudo apt update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip

```

### Instructions

You are going to make a virtual environment using python, that's what python3-venv is for.

Inside this virtual environment, you will install the dependencies.

The dependencies are listed in a text file in the repo's root directory.  requirements.txt

Python will install what is listed there using pip.  That's what python3-pip is for.

```zsh

    python3 -m venv .venv
    source .venv/bin/activate
    pip install -r requirements.txt


```

## Run Locally

Now to run the website locally on your machine, run:

```zsh

    python -m mkdocs serve

```

Now go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000) and there's your website.  
Here you can preview changes live.
