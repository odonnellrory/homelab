another day another dollar


opened laptop
its my old ubuntu one i havent used in a long time.   
which is good for this site because i can write how to set it up from fresh.

```
    git clone https://github.com/odonnellrory/odonnellrory.github.io.git
    cd odonnellrory.github.io

```

you'll need python, and if you're on a system with apt like Debian based systems this command should do it for you.


```bash

    sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip

```

oh ffs i haven't updated this thing in a year and a halfI guess that's a bonus to this docs project, because I'll have this problem again in a year and a half.

```
    sudo apt get update

```

so for the README


```
    git clone https://github.com/odonnellrory/odonnellrory.github.io.git
    cd odonnellrory.github.io

```

you'll need python, and if you're on a system with apt like Debian based systems this command should do it for you.


```bash

    sudo apt get update
    sudo apt install python3 python3-venv python3-pip

```

btw ctrl+a then ctrl+k deletes everything in the command line (yes that is the right term, it deletes everything on that line, the line you write the commands, the COMMAND + LINE)
