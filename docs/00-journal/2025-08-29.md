# 29/08/25 - Making MkDocs Directory 

Seperating template.md into two seperate files.
"How it works" is getting too big to have a markdown guide just slipped in at the bottom.
I'll make a separate markdown file.

I also changed the structure of the files to:

```
.
├── docs
│   ├── 00-journal
│   │   ├── 2025-08-23.md
│   │   ├── 2025-08-24.md
│   │   ├── 2025-08-25
│   │   │   └── workflow-success.png
│   │   ├── 2025-08-25.md
│   │   ├── 2025-08-26.md
│   │   ├── 2025-08-27.md
│   │   ├── 2025-08-28.md
│   │   └── 2025-08-29.md
│   ├── index.md
│   ├── markdownguide.md
│   ├── MkDocs
│   │   ├── installationguide.md
│   │   └── test.md
│   └── tic-tac-toe
│       ├── app.js
│       ├── index.html
│       └── styles.css
├── mkdocs.yml
├── README.md
└── requirements.txt

```

I focused mostly on the nav bar.  I left it yesterday in a sort of broken state, as long as it worked.  I've got the drop down back and I've figured out having multiple drop downs.

So I've added a new section for MkDocs and put the installation guide from the README, yesterday's work, in there and I've moved the Markdown guide to it's own file.   

I think the Markdown guide is going to become a useful resource for me, I'm happy I started this project.
