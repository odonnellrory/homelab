## Backups
Let's <redacted> this <redacted>.   My Arch machine is going down.   I want to replace it with NixOS so I can learn Nix virtualisation.  And I want to start that with virtualising my current machine on Nix.   So let's make a backup.

I've not done this before on Linux.  Well no, I made some backups early on when I started using Arch a year and a half ago but I never used them or took further backups.  Part of the reason I want to move to Nix is because it is very easy to manage your system in that way.  When you get into the bootloader it will present you with several previous versions of your own machine, when you last installed software or made changes.  That's really cool.  <Br>
Plus, you can see all of the things you've installed, I know that doesn't make a lot of sense the way I've explained it.  You will see.
