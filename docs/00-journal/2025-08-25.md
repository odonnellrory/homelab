## 9AM
 - Updated Zsh.
 - Ran system-wide package update.  (sudo pacman -Syu).

 So today I want to figure out MkDocs and document my process of making these .md files into a legible github page.

## 10AM
- Cleaned up the journal structure: instead of one giant file, I moved entries into `00-journal/` as individual dated files (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`). This will make the MkDocs site easier to generate and browse.
- Set up the `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` workflow to automatically build with MkDocs and deploy to GitHub Pages.
- Changed the repo remote from HTTPS to SSH so pushes no longer ask for tokens or crash the Git Credential Manager.
- Verified that the site went live at `odonnellrory.github.io`, though currently it only displayed the README.

I'm going out now and will continue this later.

**Next:**  
- Re-run the Actions job with the new permissions block and confirm the MkDocs site (with journal + hardware docs) actually renders.  
- If it still fails, capture the job logs to debug further.
