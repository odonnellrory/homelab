## 9AM
 - Updated Zsh.
 - Ran system-wide package update.  (sudo pacman -Syu).

 So today I want to figure out MkDocs and document my process of making these .md files into a legible github page.

---

## 10AM
- Cleaned up the journal structure: instead of one giant file, I moved entries into `00-journal/` as individual dated files (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`). This will make the MkDocs site easier to generate and browse.
- Set up the `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` workflow to automatically build with MkDocs and deploy to GitHub Pages.
- Changed the repo remote from HTTPS to SSH so pushes no longer ask for tokens or crash the Git Credential Manager.
- Verified that the site went live at `odonnellrory.github.io`, though currently it only displayed the README.

I'm going out now and will continue this later.

**Next:**  
- Re-run the Actions job with the new permissions block and confirm the MkDocs site (with journal + hardware docs) actually renders.  
- If it still fails, capture the job logs to debug further.

# 12:30PM

Got mkdocs working. The missing link was telling GitHub Actions to actually build the MkDocs site instead of just serving my repo root.  I added the proper workflow that installs MkDocs, runs mkdocs build, and then uploads the site/ directory as the artifact for GitHub Pages.

Pushed to main, re-ran the workflow, and watched the Actions logs step through checkout → Python setup → MkDocs build → deploy. This time no git errors, and the deploy step completed successfully.

Verified at odonnellrory.github.io that the MkDocs Material theme is active, the navigation links work, and my journal entries are browsable in a clean, dated structure.

Next:
 - Automate journal navigation updates (so I don’t have to hand-edit mkdocs.yml for each new entry).
 - Look into plugins like mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin to auto-sort by filename/date.
 - On the fence about format for these journal entries.  Should I add timestamps, should I not.  We'll just see how it develops over time.
 - Still need to do hardware list.
 - Could add a to do list page so I can update that when I think of new tasks.
 - Implement images.
 - Install NixOS on the laptop.
 - Update README.md
