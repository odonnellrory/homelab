## System Maintenance

- Updated Zsh.
- Ran system-wide package update (`sudo pacman -Syu`).

So today I want to figure out MkDocs and document my process of making these `.md` files into a legible GitHub Page.

---

## MkDocs Project

- Cleaned up the journal structure: instead of one giant file, I moved entries into `00-journal/` as individual dated files (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`).  
  This will make the MkDocs site easier to generate and browse.
- Set up the `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` workflow to automatically build with MkDocs and deploy to GitHub Pages.
- Changed the repo remote from HTTPS to SSH so pushes no longer ask for tokens or crash the Git Credential Manager.
- Verified that the site went live at `odonnellrory.github.io`, though currently it only displayed the README.

**Next:**

- Re-run the Actions job with the new permissions block and confirm the MkDocs site (with journal + hardware docs) actually renders.
- If it still fails, capture the job logs to debug further.

Going out now so will continue this later.

Got MkDocs working! The missing link was telling GitHub Actions to actually build the MkDocs site instead of just serving my repo root.  
I added the proper workflow that installs MkDocs, runs `mkdocs build`, and then uploads the `site/` directory as the artifact for GitHub Pages.

Pushed to `main`, re-ran the workflow, and watched the Actions logs step through 

**checkout > MkDocs build > deploy**

This time no git errors, and the deploy step completed successfully.

Verified at [odonnellrory.github.io](https://odonnellrory.github.io) that the MkDocs Material theme is active, the navigation links work,  
and my journal entries are browsable in a clean, dated structure.

**Next:**

- Automate journal navigation updates (so I don’t have to hand-edit `mkdocs.yml` for each new entry).
- Look into plugins like [`mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin`](https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin) to auto-sort by filename/date.
- Decide on journal entry format (timestamps vs. no timestamps).
- Hardware list.
- Add a To-Do list page for tracking new tasks.
- Implement images.
- Install NixOS on the laptop.
- Update `README.md`.
- Set up local preview (`mkdocs serve`) to test changes live before pushing to GitHub.

## How I Did It

- I structured the repo as `docs/00-journal/YYYY-MM-DD.md` yesterday and decided to publish with **MkDocs + GitHub Pages**.
- **Made homelab the main site:** I renamed the repo to `odonnellrory.github.io` so it serves at the root domain.
- **Switched Pages to GitHub Actions:** In *Settings → Pages* I set the source to **GitHub Actions**, so GitHub serves whatever my workflow publishes.

```yaml
# .github/workflows/gh-pages.yml
name: Build and Deploy MkDocs to GitHub Pages

  push:
    branches: [ main ]
  workflow_dispatch:

permissions:
  contents: read

          fetch-depth: 0

      - name: Setup Python
        uses: actions/setup-python@v5
        with:

      - name: Install MkDocs + theme
        run: |
          python -m pip install --upgrade pip
          pip install mkdocs mkdocs-material

      - name: Build site

      - name: Configure Pages
        uses: actions/configure-pages@v5

      - name: Upload artifact
        uses: actions/upload-pages-artifact@v3
        with:
          path: ./site

## Issues

- **Git push kept asking for a token.**  
  Even though I had SSH keys set up, the remote was still HTTPS. That made Git use the Git Credential Manager, which crashed with a SkiaSharp/Avalonia error. It fell back to username/password. 

  *Fix:* I need to switch the remote URL to SSH (`git@github.com:...`) so pushes bypass GCM entirely.

- **Pages initially only showed README.md.**  
  After renaming the repo to `odonnellrory.github.io`, GitHub Pages defaulted to serving the repo root. The docs folder wasn’t built at all.  

  *Fix:* I created a workflow under `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` that installs MkDocs, builds the site, and deploys the `site/` folder via GitHub Actions. That was the missing link.

- **Local MkDocs install errors.**  
  Arch blocks `pip install` into system Python (PEP 668). The error suggested using `pipx` or a virtual environment.  

  *Fix:* I’ll either try `sudo pacman -S mkdocs mkdocs-material` or use `pipx install mkdocs mkdocs-material` to preview locally. 

  For now, I rely on the GitHub Action build and see my changes in post.
