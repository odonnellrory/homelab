## System Maintenance

- Updated Zsh.
- Ran system-wide package update (`sudo pacman -Syu`).

So today I want to figure out MkDocs and document my process of making these `.md` files into a legible GitHub Page.

---

## MkDocs Project

- Cleaned up the journal structure: instead of one giant file, I moved entries into `00-journal/` as individual dated files (`YYYY-MM-DD.md`).  
  This will make the MkDocs site easier to generate and browse.
- Set up the `.github/workflows/gh-pages.yml` workflow to automatically build with MkDocs and deploy to GitHub Pages.
- Changed the repo remote from HTTPS to SSH so pushes no longer ask for tokens or crash the Git Credential Manager.
- Verified that the site went live at `odonnellrory.github.io`, though currently it only displayed the README.

**Next:**

- Re-run the Actions job with the new permissions block and confirm the MkDocs site (with journal + hardware docs) actually renders.
- If it still fails, capture the job logs to debug further.

Going out now so will continue this later.

Got MkDocs working! The missing link was telling GitHub Actions to actually build the MkDocs site instead of just serving my repo root.  
I added the proper workflow that installs MkDocs, runs `mkdocs build`, and then uploads the `site/` directory as the artifact for GitHub Pages.

Pushed to `main`, re-ran the workflow, and watched the Actions logs step through 

**checkout → Python setup → MkDocs build → deploy**

This time no git errors, and the deploy step completed successfully.

Verified at [odonnellrory.github.io](https://odonnellrory.github.io) that the MkDocs Material theme is active, the navigation links work,  
and my journal entries are browsable in a clean, dated structure.

**Next:**

- Automate journal navigation updates (so I don’t have to hand-edit `mkdocs.yml` for each new entry).
- Look into plugins like [`mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin`](https://github.com/lukasgeiter/mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin) to auto-sort by filename/date.
- Decide on journal entry format (timestamps vs. no timestamps).
- Hardware list.
- Add a To-Do list page for tracking new tasks.
- Implement images.
- Install NixOS on the laptop.
- Update `README.md`.
- Set up local preview (`mkdocs serve`) to test changes live before pushing to GitHub.
