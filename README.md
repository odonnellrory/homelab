# Introduction
Procrastination station.
I've turned documenting my projects into a project.
It's just a bunch of markdown files really, but I've got MkDocs and GitHub Pages turning them into an updateable feed that can be read anywhere.

The aim of this repository is to document my home network projects in a clean and reproducible manner.

Journal lives in ./docs/00-journal/.



# Installation
It's just text files.

Run:
```zsh
git clone https://github.com/odonnellrory/odonnellrory.github.io.git
cd odonnellrory.github.io
nvim .
```
